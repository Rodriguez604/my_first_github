Greetings. You may be wondering how you got here and also what I'm referring to seeing as you're the only one here in a text file that isn't directed to speak to anyone directly or invite you to a mythical world of magic and wonder. Well the answer is simple... to the first part at least. Parallel Universes. Due to the latest advancements in neurological science, we have discovered that parallel universes are actually your mind creating alternate scenarios where weird stuff happens that you can't explain. Yeah, it sounds weird and it is especially since it probably doesn't make any logica or reasonable sense and I spent way too much time writing a paragraph for a test guthub project. That is all, goodbye.
